Boilerplate code shared between my private projects and [Fluke](https://github.com/fc1943s/Fluke). How do I call it? A framework? ðŸ˜‚

Might give you a few ideas. Extensions, snippets, operators, patterns, wrappers, etc.


If you spot unidiomatic code or know a better way to implement it, I would love to know about it. 
Also, hit me up if you know a third party library/framework that does something like the stuff here, so I can replace/refactor the code that uses it.
